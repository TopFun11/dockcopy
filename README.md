 1. Modify build-docker-image.sh following instructions in that file
 2. run it. Visit localhost:8080 - enjoy working cakephp!
 3. You can use start-container.sh and stop-container.sh for starting and
stopping the container.
 4. You can remove all traces of docker images from your system (useful for debug)
 by running remove-all-docker-stuff.sh.
 5. Enjoy!
 nb. Not fully figured out MySQL stuff yet, but this is based heavily on
 (and basically is a slightly modified clone of) https://github.com/QuantumObject/docker-cakephp
 and there are some instructions there. Feel free to fix and commit.
